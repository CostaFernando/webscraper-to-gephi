 (Leominster, 
MA)","High molecular weight polylactic acid is generally produced by the
     polymerization of lactide. Lactide is prepared by the depolymerization of
     low molecular weight polylactic acid. There are difficulties in the
     preparation of high molecular weight polylactic acid and high purity
     lactide isomers due to the equilibrium between lactic acid, low molecular
     weight polylactic acid, high molecular weight polylactic acid, lactide and
     water. Further it has never been proposed to provide a continuous process
     to produce high molecular weight polylactic acid from lactic acid. The
     present invention overcomes the equilibrium problem and provides a
     continuous process."

     concentrate the lactic acid feed followed by polymerization to a
     low-molecular-weight prepolymer. This prepolymer is fed to a reactor in
     which a catalyst is added to facilitate generation of lactide, the

 (Duluth,

     and conformational discontinuities produced by congenital deformities,
     osseous and/or soft tissue pathology, traumatic injuries and functional
     atrophy is described. The device is a one piece molded body member
     composed of four substances, each of which contributes to the device, a
     specific requirement (or requirements) for osteogenesis and/or
     osteoneogenesis. Taken as a whole, the functions of these device
     constituents are integrated into a single body member which, when
     implanted into a bone defect, has the capacity to restore functional
     architecture and mechanical integrity, initiate osteoinduction and
     osteogenesis, and maintain the biological process of bone formation and
     remodeling while the host organism is simultaneously biodegrading the body
     member. The ultimate result of the functioning is formation of healthy,
     viable bone tissue where there was not bone before, while, simultaneously,
     the entire device is hydrolyzed and completely metabolized by the host
     organism. The device comprises four disparate elements: POLYLACTIC ACID,
     HYALURONIC ACID BONE MORPHOGENETIC PROTEIN and BONE DERIVED GROWTH FACTOR.
     Working together, these elements provide the following five biological
     functions prerequisite to the processes of osteoneogenesis: structural
     competence (polylactic acid), chemotaxis (hyaluronic acid),
     electronegative field (hyaluronic acid and physical-chemical
     electrokinetic events), osteoinduction (bone morphogenetic protein), and
     osteogenesis (bone derived growth factor)."

     specific requirement (or requirements) for osteogenesis and/or
     osteoneogenesis. Taken as a whole, the functions of these device
     constituents are integrated into a single body member which, when

     architecture and mechanical integrity, initiate osteoinduction and
     osteogenesis, and maintain the biological processes of bone formation and
     remodeling while the host organism is simultaneously biodegrading the body
     member. The ultimate result of the functioning is formation of healthy,
     viable bone tissue where there was not bone before, while, simultaneously,
     the entire device is hydrolyzed and completely metabolized by the host
     organism. The device comprises four disparate elements: POLYLACTIC ACID,
     HYALURONIC ACID BONE MORPHOGENETIC PROTEIN and BONE DERIVED GROWTH FACTOR.
     Working together, these elements provide the following five biological
     functions prerequisite to the processes of osteoneogenesis: structural
     competence (polylactic acid), chemotaxis (hyaluronic acid),
     electronegative field (hyaluronic acid and physical-chemical
     electrokinetic events), osteoinduction (bone morphogenetic protein), and

     biodegradable polymer degrading significantly within a month, with at
     least 50% of the polymer degrading into non-toxic residues which are
     removed by the body within a two week period. Useful polymers include
     polyanhydrides, polylactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers and
     polyorthoesters containing a catalyst; polylactic acid-glycolic acid
     copolymers are preferred. Local anesthetics are incorporated into the

     solvent casting. Prolonged release is obtained by incorporation of a
     glucocorticoid into the polymeric matrix or by co-administration of the
     glucocorticoid with the microspheres. The type of anesthetic and the

 (Cambridge,

     augmentation of breast tissue. Dissociated cells, preferably muscle cells,
     are implanted in combination with a suitable biodegradable, polymeric
     matrix to form new tissue. There are two forms of matrices which can be
     used: a polymeric hydrogel formed of a material such as alginate having
     cells suspended therein, and a fibrous matrix having an interstitial
     spacing between about 100 and 300 microns. Preferred polymeric materials
     are those degrading over about one to two months, such as polylactic
     acid-glycolic acid copolymers. The matrices can be seeded prior to
     implantation or implanted, allowed to vascularize, then seeded with cells.
     In a preferred embodiment, the cell-matrix structures are implanted in
     combination with tissue expander devices. As cell-matrix is implanted, or
     cells proliferate and form new tissue, the expander size is decreased,
     until it can be removed and the desired reconstruction or augmentation is
     obtained. The preferred cell types are muscle cells, although other types

 (Duluth, 
MN)","Device and method for treating mammalian bone deficiencies, defects, voids
     and conformational discontinuities produced by congenital deformities,
     osseous and/or soft tissue pathology, traumatic injuries and functional
     atrophy is described. The device is a one piece molded body member
     composed of four substances, each of which contributes to the device, a
     specific requirement (or requirements) for osteogenesis and/or
     osteoneogenesis. Taken as a whole, the functions of these device
     constituents are integrated into a single body member which, when
     implanted into a bone defect, has the capacity to restore functional
     architecture and mechanical integrity, initiate osteoinduction and
     osteogenesis, and maintain the biological processes of bone formation and
     remodeling while the host organism is simultaneously biodegrading the body
     member. The ultimate result of the functioning is formation of healthy,
     viable bone tissue where there was not bone before, while, simultaneously,
     the entire device is hydrolyzed and completely metabolized by the host
     organism. The device comprises four disparate elements: POLYLACTIC ACID,
     HYALURONIC ACID BONE MORPHOGENETIC PROTEIN and BONE DERIVED GROWTH FACTOR.
     Working together, these elements provide the following five biological
     functions prerequisite to the processes of osteoneogenesis: structural
     competence (polylactic acid), chemotaxis (hyaluronic acid),
     electronegative field (hyaluronic acid and physical-chemical
     electrokinetic events), osteoinduction (bone morphogenetic protein), and
     osteogenesis (bone derived growth factor)."

     solvent selected from propyleneglycol and a mixture of glycerile
     caprylate, caproate and caprate, such as glycerides of caproic, caprilic

     suspending microspheres 100 nm-200 .mu.m in diameter of a degradable
     polymer containing between 0.5% and 50% of ivermectin. The microspheres
     may be formed from polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid or a copolymer of

     significantly enhanced echogenicity as compared with microparticles not

     limit the penetration and/or uptake of water into the microparticles can
     also be incorporated into the microparticles to enhance echogenicity. In
     the preferred embodiment, the polymers are synthetic biodegradable
     polymers. The microparticles are manufactured with a diameter suitable for
     the targeted tissue to be imaged, for example, with a diameter of between
     0.5 and 8 microns for intravascular administration, and a diameter of
     between 0.5 and 5 mm for oral administration for imaging of the
     gastrointestinal tract or other lumens. Preferred polymers are polyhydroxy
     acids such as polylactic acid-co-glycolic acid, most preferably conjugated
     to polyethylene glycol or other materials inhibiting uptake by the
     reticuloendothelial system (RES). The most preferred lipids are
     phospholipids, preferably dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC),
     distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), diarachidoylphosphatidylcholine

     polymers which degrade over time. The cells can be cultured in vitro until

     approximate the desired urological structure to be replaced or repaired,
     such as the kidney, urether, bladder, urethra, and the like. Implantation
     is followed by remodeling through cell growth and proliferation in vivo.
     In another aspect of the invention, techniques are disclosed for

     a controlled manner by hydrolysis into harmless metabolites, for example,
     polyglycolic acid, polylactic acid, polyorthoester, polyanhydride, or
     copolymers thereof. The rate of tissue ingrowth increases as the porosity

 (Neenah, 
WI)","A biodegradable packaging film is provided. The film is formed from a
     blend that contains a thermoplastic starch and polylactic acid. Starch is
     a relatively inexpensive natural polymer that is also renewable and
     biodegradable. Polylactic acid is likewise an inexpensive synthetic
     polymer that is biodegradable and renewable, yet also capable of
     providing increased tensile strength to the film. Although providing a
     good combination of biodegradability/renewability and increased tensile
     strength, the polylactic acid is also relatively rigid and can result in
     films having a relatively high stiffness (e.g., high modulus of
     elasticity) and low ductility. While more ductile than polylactic acid,
     the thermoplastic starch is often difficult to melt process in film
     forming processes and very sensitive to moisture and water vapor,
     reducing its ability to be used as a stand alone packaging film. In an
     effort to counteract the effect of such polymers, an aliphatic-aromatic
     copolyester is also employed in the blend of the present invention. While
     such copolyesters are biodegradable, they also possess the melt
     properties and ductility that lend them well to the formation of films.
     Although the combination of these polymers may achieve a good balance
     between biodegradability/renewability, high tensile strength, and good
     ductility (e.g., high peak elongation), it is still often difficult to
     achieve a precise set of mechanical properties as desired for packaging
     films. In this regard, the blend also contains a filler. Due to its rigid
     nature, the amount of the filler may be readily adjusted to fine tune the
     blend to the desired degree of ductility (e.g., peak elongation) and
     stiffness (e.g., modulus of elasticity)."

     includes blending polylactic acid with a polyepoxide modifier to form a
     thermoplastic composition, extruding the thermoplastic composition
     through a die, and thereafter passing the extruded composition through a
     die to form a fiber. Without intending to be limited by theory, it is
     believed that the polyepoxide modifier reacts with the polylactic acid
     and results in branching of its polymer backbone, thereby improving its
     melt strength and stability during fiber spinning without significantly
     reducing glass transition temperature. The reaction-induced branching can
     also increase molecular weight, which may lead to improved fiber
     ductility and the ability to better dissipate energy when subjected to an
     elongation force. To minimize premature reaction, the polylactic acid and
     polyepoxide modifier are first blended together at a relatively low
     temperature(s). Nevertheless, a relatively high shear rate may be
     employed during blending to induce chain scission of the polylactic acid
     backbone, thereby making more hydroxyl and/or carboxyl groups available
     for subsequent reaction with the polyepoxide modifier. Once blended, the
     temperature(s) employed during extrusion of the blended composition can
     be selected to both melt the composition and initiate a reaction of the
     polyepoxide modifier with hydroxyl and/or carboxyl groups of the
     polylactic acid. Through selective control over this method, the present
     inventors have discovered that the resulting fibers may exhibit good
     mechanical properties, both during and after melt spinning."
